Sort out the remaining camera issues:
- Translations are still performed in world space, should be in camera space.
- Adjust the size of the translations based on the distance from the target.

Add support for additional texture image formats (.jpg, .tiff, .png).
- Use the freely available libraries for these (e.g. libjpeg, libpng, libtiff).

Widgets to display (and edit?) model attributes.

Decorations for the display:
- Render the axes.
- Render a line grid on y=0 plane.
- Render the bounding box of the object.
- Display object statistics (number of faces/verts/etc., dimensions of bounding
  box, and so on).

Allow lights to be placed arbitrarily.

Dynamically adjust the clipping planes to make sure that they always bound the
object as tightly as possible.

Playback of baked animations.
- Assume that only the vertex coords, texture coords and normals change between
  frames.
- Face data stays the same
- Material data stays the same.

Add support for .fbx using the FBX SDK?

Calculate normals when the model doesn't provide them itself.

Make it as quick as the OpenCTM viewer.
